##  Data Representation and Querying Eliza Project 2017
#### This Project is a chatbot web application called Eliza written in Go language. User can visit the application through their browser. Once sentences are typed in the user gets responses from Eliza. This repo contains a document called patterns.doc, where useful combination replies for chatbot are stored. Folder called Eliza contains program in go language which has all essential functionality for chatbot to work correctly. In static folder I created index.html file for web app, script.js for web functionality and styles.css file to style the Eliza application. Main file was created to store functions for serving static file and web server.

### What is go (programming language)?
Go (often referred to as golang) is a programming language created at Google in 2007 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. It is a compiled, statically typed language in the tradition of Algol and C, with garbage collection, limited structural typing, memory safety features and CSP-style concurrent programming features added. The compiler and other language tools originally developed by Google are all free and open source.
